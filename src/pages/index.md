  title: Why this blog?
  description: >-
    I post mostly tiny blogs about some Software Engineering principles,
    Operating Systems, Frameworks, Technologies and their related concepts which
    I feel were useful for me during my journey as a Software Engineer and
    hopefully, would be useful for you too.

        I like to follow the [KISS
        principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle). Hence, most of
        the guides, tutorials or any stuff on this blog are as intuitive as
        possible.

        I like to learn and try new things by doing hands-on experiments with
        them (read *Googling & failing a LOT*). Sometimes I find really
        easy-to-follow resources, sometimes I don't. For the times I don't, I
        like to pen down my research and post it here to give you an abstracted
        & simpler (read *NO BULLSHIT*) guide to certain things. I hope these
        blogs help you, like the way I am being helped by the many other blogs
        online.

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
