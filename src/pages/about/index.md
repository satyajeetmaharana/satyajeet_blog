title: About this blog
---
I post mostly tiny blogs about some Software Engineering principles, Operating Systems, Frameworks, Technologies and their related concepts which I feel were useful for me during my journey as a Software Engineer and hopefully, would be useful for you too.

### KISS principle

I like to follow the [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle). Hence, most of the guides, tutorials or any stuff on this blog is as intuitive as possible. 

### Motivation

I like to learn and try new things by doing hands-on experiments with them (read *Googling & failing a LOT*). Sometimes I find really easy-to-follow resources, sometimes I don't. For the times I don't, I like to pen down my research and post it here to give you an abstracted & simpler (read *NO BULLSHIT*) guide to certain things. I hope these blogs help you, like the way I am being helped by the many other blogs online.
